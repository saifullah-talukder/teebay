# Teebay Technical Documentation

## Overview

Teebay is a fullstack application designed to allow users to seamlessly rent, buy, and sell products across various categories like electronics, furniture, and more. The application is built with modern technologies, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:**

  - **Node.js (v22)**
  - **Express.js**
  - **GraphQL (Apollo Server)**
  - **Prisma (ORM for PostgreSQL)**
  - **PostgreSQL (Database)**
  - **Zod (Schema validation)**
  - **Dataloader (for GraphQL)**

- **Frontend:**
  - **TypeScript**
  - **Vite (for fast bundling)**
  - **React (v18)**
  - **Tailwind CSS**
  - **Headless UI (for accessible UI components)**

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built using TypeScript with the following general flow for handling requests:

1. **GraphQL Request Handling**:

   - When a client sends a GraphQL request, it is intercepted by a GraphQL resolver.
   - The resolver validates the payload using a **Zod schema**.
   - Upon successful validation, a service class is created and executed based on the request.
   - The service class may instantiate and call a **Dataloader** or **Repository class method** to retrieve the necessary data.
   - Dataloaders always call repository methods to fetch data, ensuring optimized database queries and preventing over-fetching.

2. **Zod Validation**:

   - Zod is used extensively for both server-side and client-side validation. For example, when processing user inputs, Zod ensures that the incoming data meets the expected format before passing it to the resolver.

   - This validation logic is applied in the backend when processing user data such as signup and create product forms.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend leverages TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS for a streamlined and responsive UI. Hereâ€™s how the frontend works:

1. **Form Validation**:

   - Forms are validated using **Zod schemas** on the frontend as well.
   - If there are validation errors, the request is not sent to the backend until the user corrects the input.
   - **Example**: A signup form checks that all fields, including password and confirm password, meet the specified criteria (e.g., length, match).

2. **Apollo Client**:
   - After successful validation, the frontend sends the request to the backend using **Apollo Client**.
   - The result of the GraphQL request is then displayed to the user on the frontend.
   - Apollo Client handles caching, state management, and network requests seamlessly, ensuring that the user interface stays responsive and up-to-date.

## Development Practices

Throughout the development of Teebay, I frequently utilized language models like **ChatGPT** and **Claude** to assist with tasks and code generation. The LLMs were provided with specific instructions on what to do and which technologies to use.

For example, I asked ChatGPT to help complete a Zod schema for password validation. The model responded with a valid schema, ensuring the password contained a number and was at least six characters long.

## Conclusion

Teebay combines modern technologies such as GraphQL, Prisma, and Zod to create a seamless and scalable fullstack application. The app is designed to be highly maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend, and optimized for a fast and responsive user experience.
